On this page users can enter R-G-B values to create the color of the pixel they want. Since pixel placement is limited to 1 pixel per 600 blocks (~2 hours), a token ID is required as an input as well before proceeding. Then the user can search the canvas to pick a pixel that they wish to change to their color. A pixel can be clicked to highlight it, then the place a pixel button can be pressed to put the pixel down onto the canvas. 

On opensea or other platforns users can see the NFT evolve and change as users place their pixels onto the canvas.
